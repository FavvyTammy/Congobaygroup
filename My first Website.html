  <h1>My First Webpage</h1>
What actually motivated me is the fact I actually wanted to learn different technological skills. Adding to my knowledge of computer and been a  computer literate, there's more to just pressing the keyboard and moving mouse.  I also have passion for technology, my major crave is website creation and I m very happy to be part of this team. I am motivated by meeting set targets within deadlines, as it gives me a sense of accomplishment and it's something that I can look back on and say "I achieved that". I'm also motivated by visible results for example, when I am to write project for my student project work next year, I will have a sense of accomplishment from knowing that my supervisors are going to read it cause it took my confidence to write it up. And for sure in the next five years, I will be in the technological business, doing what I know how to do with the some of skills I have attain.
